Hello friends, my name is Abhishek Singh and I'm from Lucknow, India. I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science Engineering and I'm the founder of this company. My dream is to make this company a tech giant, which I believe will take around 14-15 years. This is my first step towards taking my company forward, and I assure you that I will work tirelessly to make it a tech giant by 2040. By then, this company will be a well-established entity. My goal is to make this company a tech giant, but I'm not ready to disclose the details just yet. For now, I need to focus on learning and acquiring the necessary skills, which will take around 5-6 years. After that, I'll start working on implementing my plans, which will take at least 15 years to achieve. I hope you all are doing well and staying safe. That's all for now, and I'll take a break here.
